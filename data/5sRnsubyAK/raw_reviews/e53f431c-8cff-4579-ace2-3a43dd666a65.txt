Summary:
The paper introduces a new feature extraction method that leverages the form-invariance property of the Constant Q Transform (CQT). It is applied for the classification of neurodegenerative disorders, specifically Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The authors propose that CQCC, which leverages geometrically spaced frequency bins, provides superior spectrotemporal resolution compared to traditional Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The study demonstrates that CQCC, when integrated with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers, significantly outperforms MFCC, achieving absolute improvements of 5.6% and 7.7%, respectively. The effectiveness of CQCC is validated using the Italian Parkinson’s database and the Minsk2019 database of ALS

Presentation: 3: good
Contribution: 2: fair
Strengths:
This paper leverages the form-invariance property of the Constant Q Transform (CQT) to achieve superior spectrotemporal resolution compared to traditional Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The authors demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers, validated across multiple datasets. While the technical complexity may pose challenges for some readers, the research is of high quality and holds significant potential for advancing early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The paper's contributions are a valuable addition to the niche application area of disease diagnosis via audio.

Weaknesses:
Rigor in experimentation 1a. Error Analysis/ Literature comparison Although the paper includes spectrographic analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) plots to visualize feature separability, It is necessary to Conduct a detailed literature analysis of the SoTA models used for this task such as Deep feature extractors. A useful analysis would be to Identify common patterns or features that contribute to the errors and provide insights into the specific cases where the proposed method fails. This would help in understanding the contribution of CQCC as an efficient feature extractor.
1a. Cross validation/ 10 fold CV- The paper lacks external validation of the proposed CQCC method. While simple accuracy score results are promising, additional validation using independent datasets not used in the training phase would provide stronger evidence of the method's effectiveness. This could involve cross-validation with other publicly available datasets or non intersecting splits from current dataset to achieve error estimates or uncertainty scores. *(Ref see Uncertainty Quantification of Deep Learning Models)

Dataset Diversity: The study primarily uses the Italian Parkinson’s Voice and Speech dataset and the Minsk2019 ALS database. While these datasets are well-established, the paper could benefit from including more diverse datasets to ensure the generalizability of the findings. It would strengthen the validity of the results and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method across various contexts
3 Lack of Comparison with Other Deep models/ deep feature extractors: The paper compares CQCC primarily with traditional acoustic features like MFCC, Jitter, Shimmer, and Teager Energy. However, it does not provide a comparison with other advanced feature extraction methods or machine learning techniques that have go-to in most cases of such applications. Including such comparisons would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance and highlight its relative strengths and weaknesses

Questions:
Include comparisons with other deep feature extraction methods say Wav2Vec oPASE or even CNN techniques recently proposed in the literature. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of your method's performance and highlight its relative strengths and weaknesses.
