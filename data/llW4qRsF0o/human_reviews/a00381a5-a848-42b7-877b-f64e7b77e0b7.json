{"summary":"This paper introduces a physics-transfer (PT) learning framework designed to bridge digital models of varying fidelities and complexities, effectively addressing the accuracy-performance trade-off in multiscale problem analysis. By leveraging PT learning, the model achieves reduced computational costs compared to traditional machine learning models, making it a more efficient solution for understanding complex, representative physical phenomena.","soundness":"2: fair","presentation":"2: fair","contribution":"2: fair","strengths":"This model achieves lower computational costs than traditional ML models, with a method that is easy to understand.","weaknesses":"No new models have been proposed.\nWhy was CNN chosen over other state-of-the-art models?\nThe comparison methods are insufficient.\nAppropriate statistical analysis is required.","questions":"How is the credibility of the model evaluated?","ethics_flag":"No ethics review needed.","ethics_concerns":null,"rating":"5: marginally below the acceptance threshold","confidence":"1: You are unable to assess this paper and have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from different reviewers.","code_of_conduct":true}
