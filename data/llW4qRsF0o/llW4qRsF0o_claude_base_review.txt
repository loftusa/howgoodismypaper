Summary: This paper introduces a physics-transfer (PT) learning framework to address the accuracy-performance dilemma in modeling complex physical systems across multiple scales. The authors demonstrate their approach on two case studies: predicting material strength in metallic alloys and modeling brain morphological development. The framework transfers knowledge from low-fidelity/simple models to high-fidelity/complex systems, showing that neural networks can learn the underlying physics and apply it to more complex scenarios. The authors show that their method achieves good accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs compared to traditional high-fidelity simulations.

Strengths: The paper addresses an important challenge in computational modeling of complex physical systems, where high-fidelity models are computationally expensive but more accurate, while low-fidelity models are efficient but less accurate. The proposed physics-transfer learning framework is well-motivated and the case studies demonstrate its practical utility. The results show promising performance in both materials science and brain development applications, suggesting the approach is generalizable. The analysis of learned latent features showing correlation with physical descriptors provides valuable insight into why the approach works.

Weaknesses: The theoretical foundation and formal description of the PT framework is somewhat limited. While equations 1-4 outline the basic premise, a more rigorous mathematical treatment would strengthen the paper. The experimental validation, while extensive, lacks comparison with other machine learning transfer approaches (like those mentioned in the related work section). The paper is also quite dense and would benefit from clearer organization and more concise explanations. Some of the figures are complex and difficult to interpret without spending considerable time studying them.

Questions: 1. How does the physics-transfer learning approach compare quantitatively with other transfer learning methods like Î”-learning or LFAF in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency?
2. For what types of physical systems would this approach not work well? Are there limitations based on the nature of the physics being modeled?
3. The paper mentions that the learned latent variables correlate with physical descriptors. Is there a way to explicitly encourage the neural network to discover these physically meaningful latent variables?
4. How sensitive is the method to the quality and quantity of the low-fidelity data used for training?
