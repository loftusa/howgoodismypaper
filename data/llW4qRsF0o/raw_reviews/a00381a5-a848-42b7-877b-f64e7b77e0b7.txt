Summary:
This paper introduces a physics-transfer (PT) learning framework designed to bridge digital models of varying fidelities and complexities, effectively addressing the accuracy-performance trade-off in multiscale problem analysis. By leveraging PT learning, the model achieves reduced computational costs compared to traditional machine learning models, making it a more efficient solution for understanding complex, representative physical phenomena.
