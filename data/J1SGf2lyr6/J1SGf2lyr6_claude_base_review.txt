Summary: This paper presents a Feature-Aware Federated Learning (FAFL) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in 5G networks. The approach integrates feature importance into federated learning by using Integrated Gradients to compute feature importance at each client and incorporating this information in the model aggregation process, while ensuring privacy through differential privacy mechanisms. The authors also propose Dynamic Feature Importance Adaptation (DFIA) to update feature importance periodically for adapting to changing data distributions. Experiments on 5G network datasets demonstrate that FAFL outperforms traditional federated learning methods like FedAvg and FedProx in anomaly detection tasks.

Strengths: The paper addresses an important problem in 5G network security, and the concept of incorporating feature importance into federated learning aggregation is worthwhile. The authors present a comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing their method with baseline approaches, showing improved performance. The application of differential privacy to protect feature importance information is also a valuable consideration.

Weaknesses: The theoretical foundation lacks depth, particularly regarding the effect of their approach on convergence guarantees. The experimental section is limited to a single dataset with few details about its construction and characteristics. The paper claims novelty in incorporating feature importance into federated learning, but similar approaches may exist in the literature that aren't adequately discussed. The visualization of results (especially confusion matrices in Figure 1) is hard to interpret, and there's insufficient analysis of how the approach performs in different network conditions or attack scenarios.

Questions: 1. How does the Dynamic Feature Importance Adaptation compare to simply recomputing feature importance in every round? What is the computational overhead of DFIA?
2. What is the sensitivity of the model to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the privacy budget Îµ and the feature importance update interval T?
3. How would the framework perform under more adversarial conditions, such as poisoning attacks from malicious clients?
4. How was the 5G testbed environment constructed, and what specific protocols and traffic patterns were captured in the dataset?
