{"summary":"This paper propose a paradigm to offer compression flexibility and efficiency improvement for edge-device scenarios. It propose a conditional uniform-based sampler for flexible image size reduction and reconstruction, as well as a lightweight transformer-based structure to redeuce reconstruction load on the receiver side.","soundness":"2: fair","presentation":"2: fair","contribution":"2: fair","strengths":"To avoid issues stems from adjacent sampled areas, this paper add constraints for row-based randoming sampling.\n\nThis paper introduces an erase-and-squeeze method to enhance flexibility and efficiency.","weaknesses":"The proposed uniform-based sampler gives better results by adding constraints. However, it is still a rule-based sampling method that is unaware of the content. Why didn't you consider a learn-based sampler solution to improve the performance?\n\nThe input of the reconstruction. Is the masking map also needs to be coded and transmitted? Is it also an input of the reconstruction network? I think these details should also be described in Figure 2.\n\nSettings about Table 1. Easz is a lossy compression method but other super-resolution methods such as SwinIR are free from bit cost constraints. Why does the proposed method Easz show such a performance improvement (larger than 3dB)? What are the testing settings(such as the input size) for the proposed method and the other methods?\n\nSome citations are neglected, e.g., the citation for the methods in Table 1 and Table 2. Please check about these problems.","questions":"see the weakness","ethics_flag":"No ethics review needed.","ethics_concerns":null,"rating":"5: marginally below the acceptance threshold","confidence":"5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment.
