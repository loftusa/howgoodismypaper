Summary:
The paper proposes Easz, a novel image compression framework designed for edge devices, addressing the limitations of existing NN-based compression methods. By introducing an erase-and-squeeze technique, Easz allows for flexible compression levels and efficient image reconstruction, making it suitable for various IoT applications.

Soundness: 3: good
Presentation: 3: good
Contribution: 2: fair
Strengths:
The erase-and-squeeze method offers a flexible alternative to traditional uniform downsampling techniques, enhancing compression adaptability.
The framework is evaluated on a real-world testbed, providing credible evidence of its performance compared to existing compression methods.
Easz is compatible with existing compression algorithms, increasing its utility in practical applications.
Weaknesses:
The review of related work lacks depth, particularly regarding recent advancements in image compression techniques applicable to edge devices.
The reliance on GPU capabilities for reconstruction may limit the framework's applicability in low-power or resource-constrained environments.
Questions:
In the equation G_u=\left{g_u^0(i,j)=(i-1)/(h-1),g_u^1(i,j)=(j-1)/(w-1)\right}
, is 
 a coordinate in the range 
? Can the authors clearly explain the difference between the symbols 
, 
, 
, and 
?
Does the erase-and-squeeze process disrupt the spatial structure between image pixels, negatively impacting conventional compression?
Do the authors compare their performance with related work that focuses on improving the quality of compressed images (e.g., RBQE) at the same bpp?
Why do the authors focus on optimizing L1 and LPIPS in the loss function while using unparameterized perceptual metrics instead of reporting performance metrics like PSNR, MS-SSIM, and LPIPS? How do the other models, SwinIR, realESRGAN, and BSRGAN, perform on these unparameterized metrics?
Is the erasure-extrusion process unique to each image? Additionally, does the quality of the reconstructed compressed image vary as a result? Does this pose a risk for downstream tasks?
How are the 2x downsampled images in Section 4.3 obtained? Are all three models—SwinIR, realESRGAN, and BSRGAN—67MB in size? The models I download are actually 64.16MB, 63.95MB, and 63.79MB, respectively.
