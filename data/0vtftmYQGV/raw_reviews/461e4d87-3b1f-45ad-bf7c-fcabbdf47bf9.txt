Summary:
This paper introduces SNAP-TTA, a sparse Test-Time Adaptation (STTA) framework designed for latency-sensitive applications on resource-constrained edge devices. Traditional TTA methods dynamically adjust models using unlabeled test data to handle distribution shifts, but they often incur high computational costs and latency, making them impractical for real-time edge environments. SNAP-TTA addresses these challenges by introducing two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which selects class-representative and domain-representative samples to enable effective adaptation with minimal data, and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which corrects feature distribution shifts during inference without additional training. By combining SNAP-TTA with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, the paper demonstrates that SNAP-TTA achieves significant latency reductions (up to 87.5%) while maintaining competitive accuracy. Experimental results on benchmarks like CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C show SNAP-TTA’s superior performance in edge settings, making it suitable for real-world, latency-sensitive applications.

Soundness: 3: good
Presentation: 3: good
Contribution: 2: fair
Strengths:
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving high adaptation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency in Sparse Test-Time Adaptation (STTA), where updates rely on only a small subset of data.
SNAP-TTA demonstrates improved classification accuracy across adaptation rates (0.01 to 0.5) compared to baseline TTA methods on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C. At an adaptation rate of 0.1, SNAP-TTA reduces latency by up to 87.5% while mitigating accuracy loss, validating its effectiveness in STTA
IoBMN combines memory statistics from domain-representative samples with current inference batch statistics, using a soft shrinkage function to balance them. This dynamic normalization adjustment during inference effectively addresses domain shift, ensuring model adaptability and performance stability.
Weaknesses:
The reliance on a fixed confidence threshold of CnDRM may limit adaptability across varying data distributions and could lead to suboptimal sampling.
In table 5, accuracy differences between methods are small, without statistical analysis, making it unclear if these differences are significant (In Detailed comments 4)
Questions:
I have some comments as following:

Some results for latency and performance metrics on mobile or embedded systems would be helpful, to further validate the method’s effectiveness and robustness

Some in-depth analysis of specific limitations would be helpful, such as how memory overhead might impact performance on resource-constrained devices and how SNAP-TTA handles highly dynamic data distributions in real-world applications. Additionally, there is no discussion on potential trade-offs between latency reduction and accuracy under different conditions

The combined CnDRM+IoBMN method performs best, but the contribution of each component is not discussed. A brief explanation of how they work together would improve clarity. The table 5 only shows results at an adaptation rate of 0.1, the authors can mention that the complete data is in appendix.
