Summary: The paper introduces SNAP-TTA, a sparse test-time adaptation framework designed for latency-sensitive applications running on edge devices. Traditional test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require significant computational resources, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments. SNAP-TTA addresses this by reducing adaptation frequency and data usage through two key components: (1) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which selects samples that are both class-representative and domain-representative for efficient adaptation; and (2) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which adjusts normalization layers during inference using these representative samples. The authors demonstrate that SNAP-TTA maintains competitive accuracy even at very low adaptation rates (as low as 0.01) while significantly reducing latency across multiple state-of-the-art TTA methods and benchmark datasets.

Strengths: The paper identifies and addresses a real-world problem of applying TTA methods in resource-constrained settings where latency is a critical concern. The proposed approach is practical and well-motivated, with a clear focus on making TTA methods feasible for edge devices. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, ImageNet-C), various adaptation rates (0.01-0.5), and several state-of-the-art TTA methods (Tent, CoTTA, EATA, SAR, RoTTA). The paper includes real-device implementations and measurements on Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, demonstrating substantial latency reductions (up to 87.5%) with minimal accuracy trade-offs. The orthogonal nature of the proposed method to existing TTA approaches makes it widely applicable and potentially impactful.

Weaknesses: The theoretical justification for why the proposed class-domain representative sampling approach works well could be strengthened. While there are intuitive explanations and empirical results, a deeper analysis of why this specific combination is effective would improve the paper. The evaluation on continual domain shift scenarios (Appendix F.2) is relatively limited compared to the main experiments, though this is a secondary focus of the paper. The computational overhead analysis focuses primarily on latency rather than a comprehensive analysis of both memory and computational requirements, though some memory information is provided in the appendix. The paper introduces several hyperparameters (confidence threshold, momentum factors, soft shrinkage parameters) without thorough analysis of their sensitivity or guidelines for setting them in new applications.

Questions: 1. How sensitive is the performance of SNAP-TTA to the confidence threshold for CnDRM and the momentum parameter for domain centroid updates? Is there a systematic way to determine these values for new datasets or applications?

2. For the IoBMN component, how was the value of Î±=4 determined, and how does performance vary with different values?

3. Have you explored dynamic adaptation rates that could potentially adjust based on the detected domain shift magnitude, rather than using fixed adaptation rates?

4. How does SNAP-TTA perform when the model architecture is varied significantly (e.g., smaller models like MobileNet that might be more appropriate for edge devices)?
