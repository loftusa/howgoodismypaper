{"summary":"This work proposes a novel RL framework for large scale traffic signal control, independent of the road network topology, based on the transformer architecture, together with a pipeline for generating diverse environments for this setting.","soundness":"1: poor","presentation":"1: poor","contribution":"2: fair","strengths":"This work addresses an important and challenging setting, traffic signal control. It demonstrates the approach on large-scale settings, with up to 73 agents.","weaknesses":"The work has merits and interesting contributions, but I argue it also has clarity issues and requires additional work on the empirical validation and presentation. I detail below some key issues and point to a few questions that can hopefully guide the future development of this contribution.\n\nThe first remark concerns the problem formulation. The multi-agent setting is defined using the MDP framework (i.e., single-agent setting), but using a joint action space. Should we understand that the MARL setting is approached using a centralised learning paradigm? Also the motivation for learning enriched states using information exchange signals a partially observable setting. I advise to reconsider the mathematical framework, given all these elements. Perhaps a Dec-POMDP [1] is more appropriate? See Q1.\n\nFurther clarity issues regards the two stage state encoding:\n\nThe idea of using PointNet to generate an encoding independent of the road network size is interesting. But one can also argue that lane level information is detailed information, that is not always available. See Q3.\nIt is not clear how exactly the communication is defined as a sequence modeling problem. As far as I understand the transformer further encodes into the state the topology information. See Q4.\nFinally, the evaluation was only performed against MAPPO and it is unclear what the 300 mentioned experiments were, since the presented results do not seem to be averaged over multiple runs. There are numerous potential baselines that could strengthen the results: [2, 3, 4]. While the related work was great within the application domain, there is a lot left to explore on the algorithmic side.\n\n[1] Oliehoek, F. A., & Amato, C. (2016).

Could you explain the MDP framework choice and why you did not opt for a multi-agent formalisation, such as a Dec-POMDP? What is the training and execution paradigm for your approach in this case? Is it a fully centralised approach?\n\nQ2. Is the conditioning on the phase times and action space kept for the entire framework, I did not see any other reference to this beyond Eq. 3, or how this is incorporated in the policy network, after the augmented state is generated (Eq. 6, 7).\n\nQ3. Is the lane level information a reasonable assumption in TSC settings?\n\nQ4. Could you clarify how exactly the communication is formulated as a sequence modelling problem? Could you clarify what are the differences with [2] and would that approach be applicable in your setting? I would argue that might be an important related work to also discuss.\n\nQ5. Can you motivate the baseline choice and why other GNN or communication/transformer-based MARL methods were not considered?","ethics_flag":"No ethics review needed.","ethics_concerns":null,"rating":"3: reject, not good enough","confidence":"4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.
