Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to Traffic Signal Control (TSC) using multi-agent reinforcement learning. The authors model communication between intersection agents as a sequence problem, enabling them to exchange information. The architecture utilizes point cloud processing and graph neural networks to handle varying road network topologies, making it adaptable to different numbers and types of intersections. The authors demonstrate that their approach can be trained on both real and randomly generated road networks, and show that even with minimal state information, their system achieves competitive performance compared to static traffic control baselines.

Strengths: The paper addresses an important real-world problem with significant economic and environmental impacts. The approach to model varying-sized road networks is novel and potentially impactful, allowing the same model to be applied to different road configurations without retraining. The automatic dataset generation pipeline is a valuable contribution that could benefit future research. The experimental results show clear improvements over static traffic control baselines, with notable reductions in CO2 emissions and waiting times. The observation that minimal state information can achieve competitive results is significant for practical deployment.
Weaknesses: The experimental evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods mentioned in the related work section. While the paper mentions several existing approaches (IDQN, IPPO, MPLight, FMA2C, etc.), the experiments only compare against a static traffic light baseline. The ablation studies could be more thorough to demonstrate the impact of different components of the architecture. The paper claims convergence for complex networks but acknowledges that for multi-network training "our model has yet to show convergence with these advanced settings," which raises questions about the method's scalability. The presentation could be improved with clearer descriptions of the architecture and training process.
Questions: 1. How does your approach compare quantitatively with the existing methods mentioned in your related work section (IDQN, IPPO, MPLight, FMA2C, etc.)? 2. What is the computational complexity of your transformer-based approach compared to other methods, especially as the number of intersections scales up? 3. Could you elaborate on why minimal state information achieves similar performance to full observation? Is this consistent across all network complexities? 4. What are the main challenges preventing convergence in the multi-network training scenario? 5. Have you tested your approach on any standard TSC benchmarks like those in RESCO?
