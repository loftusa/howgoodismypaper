Summary:
This paper introduces a hybrid batch training approach for multilingual information retrieval by combining monolingual and cross-lingual training data. The core methodology relies on mixing different types of training data using probability weights α and β. While the implementation is straightforward, the novelty of the contribution is limited.

Soundness: 2: fair
Presentation: 3: good
Contribution: 2: fair
Strengths:
Addresses a relevant challenge in multilingual information retrieval.
Provides comprehensive experimental validation across multiple benchmark datasets (XQuAD-R, MLQA-R, MIRACL).
Weaknesses:
The primary contribution merely combines two existing training approaches with probability weights, presenting a straightforward and obvious solution.
The paper employs translated QA pairs as data augmentation, creating an unfair comparison with baseline methods that do not utilize this advantage.
Questions:
None.

Flag For Ethics Review: No ethics review needed.
Rating: 3: reject, not good enough
