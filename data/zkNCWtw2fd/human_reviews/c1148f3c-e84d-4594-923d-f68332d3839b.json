{"summary":"The paper studies information retrieval tasks where monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual setups are examined. The paper studies different batch sampling approaches at the training time without modifying existing training loss (e.g., contrastive learning loss) or model architectures. Specifically, the paper argues that existing approaches either use (i) monolingual batching where the languages of query and documents are matched, but they can be of different languages, or (ii) cross-lingual batching where the languages of query and documents are different. Based on this, the paper proposes hybrid batching, which is the mixing of these two batching methods.\n\nExperiments are conducted on two base models (XLM-R and LaBSE) and evaluated on two tasks (XQuAD-R, MLQA-R, MIRACL). To train systems with data in various languages, the paper employs in-house machine translation to translate existing training corpora (described in Section 3.1). The experimental results show that hybrid batching, generally, outperforms monolingual-only and cross-lingual-only in a range of setups, including monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual.","soundness":"2: fair","presentation":"2: fair","contribution":"2: fair","strengths":"The paper shows that two standard batching strategies are complementary for information retrieval tasks, as the combination of them shows improvements.","weaknesses":"Limited evaluations are only QA datasets (e.g., the main text only shows XLM-R and LaBSE). Also, the main text consists of many large tables where each does not present as much information as the space it takes, e.g., the authors could summarize how many languages/scenarios the proposed method shows improvements instead of providing large tables like Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, etc.\n\nIt is not clear if the proposed method is actually effective. In many cases, the improvements appear rather small. For example, in Table 1, on XQuAD-R for XLM-R (0.792 vs 0.798; 0.705 vs 0.700; 0.593 vs 0.593). Are they even statistically significant?\n\nAs this paper mainly provides empirical observations, it would be stronger if the paper provides insights on which scenario (e.g., what kind of base model or dataset) where hybrid batching is expected to show significant improvements and when it does not. The current paper pretty much reports experimental findings which could limit its usefulness. Several questions remain, for example, what is the size and mixed of training data does one need to see the impact of this hybrid batching? I expect that if there is limited training data, the impact would be marginal.","questions":"Related to weakness1, could this proposed method be extended to other tasks in addition to QA?\nCan you discuss my weakness 2.\nCan you discuss my weakness 3.","ethics_flag":"No ethics review needed.","ethics_concerns":null,"rating":"3: reject, not good enough","confidence":"3: You are fairly confident in your assessment.
