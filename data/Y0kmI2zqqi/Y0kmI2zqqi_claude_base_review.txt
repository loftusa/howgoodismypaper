Summary: This paper introduces Stochastic Sparse Sampling (SSS), a framework for variable-length time series classification specifically designed for medical applications. SSS works by sparsely sampling fixed windows from variable-length signals, processing each window independently with a local model, then aggregating these local predictions into a global classification. The authors evaluate SSS on seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization using intracranial EEG data from multiple medical centers, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods both for in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. The framework also offers natural interpretability through visualization of local window predictions.

Strengths: The paper addresses a significant challenge in medical time series analysis - handling variable-length data without resorting to padding, truncation, or interpolation. The proposed framework has several noteworthy strengths:
1. The method is conceptually simple yet effective, showing strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics.
2. The empirical evaluation is thorough, testing on data from multiple medical centers and in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.
3. The approach naturally provides interpretable visualizations of which parts of the signal contribute most to the classification.
4. The framework is backend-agnostic, allowing it to be combined with any fixed-window time series classification method.

Weaknesses: Several aspects of the work could be improved:
1. The theoretical foundation is somewhat limited. While the paper provides a proof regarding the validity of the aggregation function, deeper theoretical analysis of why SSS works better (especially in OOD settings) would strengthen the paper.
2. The calibration methods are discussed but their impact is not thoroughly analyzed in the experiments section.
3. The visualizations in Figures 2 and 3, though insightful, lack medical expert validation or interpretation - the paper doesn't confirm if the highlighted regions correspond to clinically relevant patterns.
4. The paper doesn't explore potential sampling strategies beyond random uniform sampling, which could potentially improve performance.

Questions: 1. How does the model performance change with different sampling strategies (e.g., stratified sampling based on signal characteristics, or adaptive sampling focusing on regions with high variance)?
2. Have you evaluated whether the signals highlighted by SSS (as shown in Figures 2 and 3) correspond to clinically meaningful patterns according to medical experts?
3. The paper uses fixed window sizes for sampling. Have you explored using multiple window sizes simultaneously to capture patterns at different time scales?
4. Given the superior OOD performance, do you have any insights on why infinite-context methods generally perform better than finite-context methods in OOD scenarios?
